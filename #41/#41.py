# /*
#  * This is a special challenge for Halloween.
#  * You find yourself exploring an abandoned mansion full of rooms.
#  * In each room, you'll have to solve a riddle to advance to the next one.
#  * Your mission is to find the candy room.
#  *
#  * This involves implementing an interactive question-and-answer game via the terminal.
#  * (You have total freedom to be creative with the texts)
#  *
#  * - üè∞ House: The mansion corresponds to a 4 x 4 square structure
#  *   that you should model. Rooms with a door and candy do not have a riddle.
#  *   (16 rooms, one for entry and one where the candy is located)
#  *   This could be a representation:
#  *   üö™‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è
#  *   ‚¨úÔ∏èüëª‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è
#  *   ‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏èüëª
#  *   ‚¨úÔ∏è‚¨úÔ∏èüç≠‚¨úÔ∏è
#  * - ‚ùì Riddles: Each room presents a random riddle that you must answer with text.
#  *   If you don't solve it, you can't move.
#  * - üß≠ Movement: If you solve the riddle, you'll be asked where you want to move.
#  *   (Example: north/south/east/west. Only possible options should be provided)
#  * - üç≠ Exit: You leave the house if you find the candy room.
#  * - üëª (Bonus) Ghosts: There's a 10% chance that a ghost appears in a room and
#  *   you have to answer two questions to leave.
